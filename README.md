# Guess The Word Frontend
This repository holds the frontend code for my Guess the word game. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/orijer/GuessTheWordBackend).

In the game there is a secret word that the player needs to find by asking how similar the guess and hidden words are to each other.

My main inspiration was of course [samental](https://semantle.ishefi.com/), but I wanted to create a game that both allowed the player to use as many hints as they want, and allowed players to play with other words after they find the daily word.

# Code
I used REACT to create the frontend, with bootstrap for the css.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`
Deploys the build folder in github pages.
